# Indian_CisAB_Casereport

This repository comprises a list of data files elaborating the methodology and data analysis of a rare cis-AB blood group identified in Indian subcontinent

The sample used in the study was subjected to whole exome sequencing. Computational analysis of the sequencing data duly invloved the alignment of the raw sequencing output files to GRCh37/hg19 human reference genome. This was followed by systematic compilation of genetic variations in Variant Call Format (VCF) file.
